        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>Here are some projects that I have worked on and am proud of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://projectscheduletannersitton.tiiny.site" target="_blank">This is a link to a project Schedule for a project that I worked on for a Project Management course.</a></li>
            <li>
                In my Database Management class we completed a project where we made our own database, we created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), completed
                the logical design for the database, and then implemented the database in SQL Server.
            </li>
            <li>
                In my second programming class at the University of Oklahoma, we had an assignemnt where we had to make a professional website that basically served as a website resume, which is this website you are currently on!
            </li>
